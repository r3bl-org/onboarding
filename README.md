# onboarding

I am glad that you are excited about the project. It's very retro, kinda like 8-bit video games
meets GUI apps meets the terminal ðŸ˜Š.

Rust is a really good programming language (it's not perfect). I think there will be a solid future
for it. Its biggest selling point is memory safety (vs C/C++) and performance (comparable to C/C++).
So it's a systems level language that kind of looks like JS ðŸ˜ƒ. It was made by Mozilla so the
connection to the web & browsers & JS is very much there.

## Getting started learning Rust

If you'd like to take a look at Rust, here are some great starting points.

-   [Rust book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) (experimental & enhanced version of the Rust book)
-   Rustlings: You can go the JetBrains IDE route or terminal based
    -   [JetBrains IDE route](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16631-learn-rust/)
    -   [Terminal & your favorite editor](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
-   [Rust language basics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP2yfE2-FXdQmXLvrQ5QN64enbF_KCYQW)

## Installing Rust toolchain and IDE on your machine

## TUI concepts and Unix terminal concepts

Hope you are doing well. Here are some great YT video playlists to learn Rust & Text User Interface
(TUI) concepts.

-   [Working w/ Text User Interfaces intro](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP2yfE2-FXdQw0I6O4YdIX_mzBeF5TDdv)
-   [Simple layout management for Text User Interfaces](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkkNzJtrmgs1ISu3407av-QhocYZAduYv)
-   [Deep dive into Unix shells, ptys, etc (the raw underlying OS functions that we use to generate TUIs)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFAC320731F539902)

# onboarding

I am glad that you are excited about the project. It's very retro, kinda like 8-bit video games
meets GUI apps meets the terminal üòä.

Rust is a really good programming language (it's not perfect). I think there will be a solid future
for it. Its biggest selling point is memory safety (vs C/C++) and performance (comparable to C/C++).
So it's a systems level language that kind of looks like JS üòÉ. It was made by Mozilla so the
connection to the web & browsers & JS is very much there.

## Installing Rust toolchain and IDE on your machine

- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - [Vscode + Rust analyzer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust)
  - üí° When you simply open the [`r3bl_rs_utils` repo](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl_rs_utils) in VSCode it will ask you to install some extensions that
    are recommended. Please do this as it will make your development experience much nicer!

## Getting started learning Rust

If you'd like to take a look at Rust, here are some great starting points.

## TUI concepts and Unix terminal concepts

Here is the source file for this drawing:

Here are some great YT video playlists to learn Rust & Text User Interface (TUI) concepts.

## Learning Rust

- [YT video playlist on Crust of Rust](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa)
- https://developerlife.com/2022/03/02/rust-grep-cli-app/
  - Build a command line interface application ‚Äúgrep‚Äù and use this tutorial to get started.
  - We can work on this application over the time of your internship and make it ‚Äúreal‚Äù and add lots
    of features to it that the real ‚Äúgrep‚Äù program has today. These include:
    - Command line arguments using the clap Rust crate.
    - Implementing the ability to support unix ‚Äúpipes‚Äù, eg: ‚Äúls | grep foo‚Äù
- https://github.com/r3bl-org/address-book-with-redux-tui
  - This is a pedagogical example to help you understand Rust memory management and mutation along
    w/ Redux.
  - You can even work on implementing a TUI interface on top of this after you get comfortable with
    it to get a handle on the TUI library itself.
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch00-00-introduction.html
  - This is the Rust book that can be a handy reference on your journey of learning Rust.

## Getting started w/ the r3bl crates

Small crate to learn about Rust, testing, and ANSI:
- https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl_ansi_color/

Small crate to learn about text user interfaces, more Rust, and crossterm:
- https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl_tuify/

Large crate to work w/ TUI:
- https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl_rs_utils/tree/main/tui#run-the-demo-locally
  - Follow the instructions here to get the repo cloned on your computer.
  - Install nu shell using `cargo install nu` so that you can run the `.nu` scripts in the repo.
- Go through the demos and make sure you run them.
- Go through the README and let me know if things are missing or if they need better explanations.
  Here are some issues to take a look at: - https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl_rs_utils/issues/86 -
